# 🧪 system-design-labs

**Real systems. Real code. Real trade-offs.**

🚀 Hands-on implementations of real-world system design problems in **Go** and **Rust**.
This repo focuses on building **production-oriented backend and distributed systems** from first principles — no diagrams without code, no theory without execution.

---

## 🎯 Why This Repo Exists

* 🔧 Turn system design ideas into **running systems**
* ⚖️ Expose **engineering trade-offs**, not just clean architectures
* 🧩 Practice **step-by-step design → implementation**
* 📈 Build intuition for **scale, reliability, and performance under load**

❌ Not an interview cheat sheet.
✅ Every system is executable, testable, and stress-tested where it matters.

## 📦 What’s Inside

Each system lives as an independent module and typically includes:

* 📝 Clear problem definition and constraints
* 🧠 Key design decisions and assumptions
* 🦀 / 🐹 Go and/or Rust implementations
* 🔀 Concurrency and synchronization logic
* 🧪 Basic tests and load/stress scenarios
* 🧭 Known limitations and next-step improvements

### Example systems

* 🆔 ID generators
* 🔗 URL shorteners
* 🚦 Rate limiters
* 🗂️ Job queues
* 🕷️ Web crawlers
* ⚡ Caching layers

## 🧠 Engineering Philosophy

* ✍️ Prefer **explicit, readable code** over clever abstractions
* 🛠️ Optimize for **correctness before performance**
* 📊 Measure behavior under load instead of guessing
* 💥 Treat failures as **first-class design inputs**

## 🚧 Status

Actively evolving.
Systems are added incrementally and refined as complexity and scale increase.
